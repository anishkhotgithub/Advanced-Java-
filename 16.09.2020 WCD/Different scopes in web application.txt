Different Scopes in Web Application:

1) Page Scope
2) Request Scope
3) Session Scope
4) Application Scope


	Request Scope:
		Send data from one page to another.
		Once second page receives data, automatically data
		is removed from scope.
		Means we can only use data in second page which received it.
		And no other page in application can use the data.
		
	Session Scope:
		IN session scope we don't send data from page to other pages.
		Instead of sending we inject data in the browser.
		Now, all pages can use that data because.
		Finally all pages are going to open in browser.
